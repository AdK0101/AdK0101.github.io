                So, again. My name is Aditya Khan. I was born in Bangladesh
                but I immigrated to Canada when I was very young. As a result, 
                I am fluent in both English and Bengali. I'd like to add to that
                list of languages, so I'm trying my hand at French too, with no
                small help from the brilliant teachers at my school. I live with
                my mother, my father, and my sister.

                Throughout my life, one of the few constants has been my
                drive to learn. Of course, a lot of this is done through
                schooling. From grades 5-8, I was part of the SAGE (formerly
                Actal) program at Greystone Heights. It was there that I 
                honestly think I made my best friends. I think that my time
                at Greystone was a lot more fun than high school (even if I'll
                never admit it to my elementary school friends' faces). But, 
                high school has been fun too. I'm a part of the International
                Baccaulaeureate (IB) program now, and <i>man</i> is it a slog.
                But, in truth, I would never replace my time in IB for any
                other learning opportunity. The education program is that good.

                Looking forward into the future, I have made up my mind that I
                will go to university. I am hoping to major in Statistics, and
                follow my father's footsteps in that field. But, we'll see. The
                future is always uncertain. Hoping for the best though.
