                <strong>History</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Studying history is a absolute joy for me. I truly think
                that history is the truest stories that people can ever
                tell. History has so many tragic and beautiful stories
                that truly show the greatness of humanity and civilization.
                History as well, shows us the darkest and inhumane aspects
                of humanity. Both aspects are important to our understanding 
                of who we are today. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Putting aside that pretentious spiel, I just like reading about
                history. Simple as that.

                <strong>Geography and Society</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Just as I love learning about history, I also like learning
                about current society. There is certainly something interesting
                about learning about the different traditions that you see 
                around the world. You can learn much about the nature of 
                humanity, from simply analyzing the different ways that humans
                form and structure people-groups around the world.

                <strong>Debate</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a debater, and I have debated since grade 5 (taking
                one year off in grade 10). I have reached at least provincials
                in every year that I have debated. Equally, I have medalled at
                both on the regional circuit, and at provincials. Twice I have 
                debated on the national level, once in grade 9 and the other 
                in grade 11. In fact, I debated in nationals just a few days ago. 
                Because of COVID-19, we had to do the debate tournament online, which 
                was an <i>experience</i>. I debate currently with my partner, 
                Dawson Puderak. A picture of me after the recent debate tournament 
                is posted below.
