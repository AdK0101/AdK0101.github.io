                <strong>Cricket</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Cricket has got to be my favorite sport. I know many
                people can call it boring to watch and play, but I 
                think that the long nature of the game only adds to the
                drama. Cricket is one of those few games that truly
                has the time to really ebb and flow across days.

                <strong>Soccer</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Soccer is also one of my favorite sports to not only
                watch, but also play. I have been playing soccer since
                I was young. I have played for the Eastside Soccer club
                in Saskatoon, and before that, community soccer. Nowadays,
                I play soccer for my high school team. I primarily play as
                a defender.

                <strong>Basketball</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Basketball is a sport that I have picked up a liking for
                relatively recently (by relatively, I mean like 4 years ago).
                My favorite Canadian basketball team is by default, the
                Toronto Raptors. Likewise, my favorite American team is the
                LA Clippers. I've always loved a good underdog story, and 
                basketball is honestly full of them.
