            <p>
                My name is <strong>Aditya Khan</strong>. I hope that you enjoy looking
                through this website that I created for a school project. I made this
                website back in grade 11, but now I am in first year university. 
                I have added a few different pages to this website to
                illustrate who I am. The things you will learn about me 
                are as follows: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who I am, exactly.</li>
                <li>My love for the English language</li>
                <li>My general hobbies</li>
                <li>My love for sports</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In truth, I would not really consider myself an 
                interesting person, nor do I aspire to be one either.
                I'm happy with my place in the world. But, on the off
                chance that you do consider me a person of interest, 
                then I suppose its all the better. 
            </p>
