                <strong>Intro and Books I Like</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                I have always loved to read and write. To me, 
                the art of language is a great unifier of people.
                It is the art form that I prefer. As a result, I love
                to read both fiction and non-fiction books. With that 
                said, I will always prefer fiction. It is my favorite
                form of escapism. Often, I find that fiction can teach
                us great truths that even reality will have a tough time
                teaching us. Given that extended spiel about books, I 
                think it is only right, that I also lise some of the 
                favorite books that I have read over the years.

                <strong>My Writing</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
            I also write. As of now, I only publish non-fiction work
            online (if only because I'm not yet confident in my fiction
            work). I write articles online, chronicling various current
            events, politcs and other topics from my point of view. I
            publish typically on Medium, but also on some other websites.
            I will link my work on Medium, because that is where the vast
            majority of my work is. I will also link to The Stemodity 
            Initiative. I have only published one work on it, but it's
            an ongoing project by a group of high schoolers, that I have
            some love for. Click on the icons below, to visit the sites!
